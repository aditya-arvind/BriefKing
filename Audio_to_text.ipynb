       "\"I will begin with the earth. Study of first class of optimization problems which is. Optimisation. A function. Over. An open set. So. What this means is that the. Feasible region. Open sex. And. Function. Aur. Photo function. Kylie. Jaipur. Function. You love you know this to be. Differentiable function. Now. Going to talk about differentiable functions i need to tell you a little bit about. Bhai notation for derivatives second derivatives install. Let s be a function. From. R and 2r. Nxn aryan. I will write it. I will be not it in the sort of way. Co-ordinate size. This is the. Every vector x narayan this we will be referring to fitted as a column vector. Now. When i write something like s x. Valuated at exide. What this means is this is me. Derivative. Office. At. Exact. Smallest year. Smallest in this notation this simply said that. Derivative with respect to x. Bittu. This should be important when we are talking about. Functions that are functions of more than one way. We may want to take derivative only with recipe. Derivative. Another notation for the same thing. Is. Value added tax. Aur. Important thing to note is that this. This quantity app. Xx. This is actually a role actor. Google. It is defined in this way you can consider the partial derivatives. With respect to each of the components of x. Daman to erode. Evaluate all of these attic. Sof subex evaluated at expert is this row vector. There is a related quantity. Denoted in this sort of way. Aur. To be more explicit about. What's your differentiating with. This way and that is simply. The transpose of this perimeter. This thing is called. The gradient. Offer. Attack. Once again the. Small express. Simply do not. That. Gradient with respect to the variable. Propose. You have a function f which is. Function from. Aryan. Cross rm. You are. My very well. Bi variable x. X variable live. Aryan. Why variable is in array. Dainik bhai write something like this f sub x. Write something like this left cervix. At. White korma white. This year. In this row vector or column vector. It is a robot. Ok. Abhi to how many components. And company. Because that is the number of component and taking the derivative with. Accident. Zero vector. Also denoted by. Now if. F is. Both of these cases here in this case as well as in. Dalia case. Go to biscuits. F was a function that map to our. The sof. Itself did not have. Multiple. Rajasv incomp. F is a scalar valued. Wooden now if f is better value. Write the square. Inner value. S. A vector valued function then say we have. Suppose f is a function from r in. Rustom rm. And. What we will do if we will think of this. Every. Output of this vector. Every point in the. Image of this of f is itself a vector. Call ambedkar. F. Be part of like this if. Atta point. X. Is equal to. This kind of column vector. F1 of x. F2 effect. Gov.in. I'm calling. If i want to do if i take the derivative of x with respect to x. What i need to do is. 1 the derivative of each of these component. This. Evaluated at. Now become. Every row. Every every component of f. Will have a derivative and will its derivative would be a row vector like this. And what you are going to get now is row vector stop that one below the other so the. Pradesh. Ko dikhao. So that's your. This is also good. Multiple name for this. Simple. Call derivative. Aap f. At at. Other name for it is that it. Alter jacobian. Ok. Hi tech. How we can also write hai. Another higher order derivative. What's called. Asian. Asian is simply. Profile pic. Of the derivative. But the derivative of the day. I need to take. I am taking the derivative of the derivative. Nothing. Select. I am taking the derivative. Of the gradient. Evaluating that. This. Another term for the same. Another way of writing the same thing. This again. Because the gradient is a column vector. Pick the derivative of that. Anda. Then we'll go. Agnimitra. Matrix that look. Aur didi valuated natak. Another notation for the same thing is simply. Dell square. Evaluated. Along with derivatives you also need. Important. Advertence to derivatives. Derivatives of different derivatives and approximations of. Rishte ram. Could be known to you in some of the other form probably before this. This is. Basically said that if you have a differentiable function. The value of the function. Close. Reference point. Value of a function very close to that reference. What taylor's theorem is basically saying. Is. Diet. Close to that reference point. Value of the function. Is. Very well approximated. Bye. Linear function. That you can construct during the value of the function at the point and the derivative of the. What does it mean by well approximated. What is the centre of the earth. That is the party what is made precise by. But the main idea is basically that. When you are close if your function is differentiable. And you want to look at what how the function behaves near a point. Some reference point want to know. Well near it out. Tell you that. Alina. Approximation. Can you open. Gallery vault backup. Kalyan. Very precise. So. Calling. Let. F form. Current war. B.ed principal. Let a be a point in array. This is my reference point. American. What i want to know is how does the function behave. At another point. Dengudu. Lyrics. Start of function age. Such that. You take. Peppa pig. Then that's value of the function at x that other point x. Is given by the. Even as a pop a. Ok. In my location i want to. Abusing. During this bikes let me do not this bye. Huawei. You know my reference point is a and my point at which i want to evaluate the functional is called that why. F y is equal to f. Love. What is this vector now this is a row vector. Which is the derivative of s. With respect to 1. Evaluated at. Sudha transport. Why minus. Love. Function. Age of vi. X minus. Where. This is important part. With h. Fb. Tends to zero. As. White. Ok. Now i want to appreciate what this order what this theorem is actually saying. President as we go into the next hour main result also. But. Remember. I just this for. Clarity le i want to do. What does a. Aaj y tends to a of course it is true that. Ok bye. And if of a will come close with. Aaj vi 10th a. 45 in a brochure for free. But that is not saying anything. What this theorem is saying is. That is white and 2a. Locate app of y minus frp. Iphone 5 - 1 copy. Divide the whole thing by y minus a. Start behaving more and more like. Effects of. What this theorem is effective listening. Is that. Look at the. Of course true that. Is white and 2a. X tends to a type of white and swift of a. What we say i am telling you is how fast does white and. Gazette of white n2f4. Acquaintance. What this is a gadget telling you. Can you somehow. Images on. This different. Telling you that this difference. Map of y minus of a. / -. This. Is. Something. Is equal to effect. Ok. Sketch of vi. With each of y is a quantity that will become smaller and smaller. This will become small. As white ants. Become close to zero as white. Mukesh. What vitamins actually effect. Telling you. It is not only telling you that. The function values near. 8 lost 2fa. But we already know. It is also tell you how fast the approaches copy. Ok launcher coffee at a rate. That is. Linear in y minus. And the constant of linearity there. Roughly equal to effects of a. Effects of a plus this age of why my right of why become smaller and smaller as you go. All optimization is about this. About fast. Different quantities convert. Read the relative rates at with different quantities converges. Computer. Eating all the time in ok. That is why. An estimate like the like this one which come from taylor's theorem. Enna sona. Now let's go forward and actually. Sexy how this. Postman download. So. Now i want to talk about. Go back to work. Topic started messages that you want to. Optimisation of a function over. Open set. Kishor. I want to talk of minimum minimising a function f. Oversight. Sofa set. Feasible region. Feasible region. This isn't some open. Assume that f is different. Right. The theorem. Net. B. Inoperable. Solution. Optimisation problem. Minimum. Minimise. Function f. Subject. Let f. Video constable. And let.

Sing that. Consider consider this optimization problem. Suppose there is an optimal solution. It is not saying there is enough. Singh suppose the return of rebel. And. Documentation problem has the feature has the properties that f is differentiable. And the feasible region is a open set. Then it has to be that. The derivative. Of the function with respect to x. Evaluated at axa. Chunav latest let's prove this. Akshara licinius. And. S is open. What do we know. Effector is a point anus. Set s gopan. What must be the case. When there is a ball around around extra that lies completely in a. Picture if you have in mind is to suppose imagine this is your sad s. This is your point. There is a ball around it like this. That lies completely. What that means. Bed exercise. Radius are greater than zero. 5000000. X belongs s. Whenever. Distance between x and xr. National. What is unique about. About the ball. What is so interesting about the ok there is a ball around the point x serve it lies completely in. So what what if there is a bond. What is what so great about. About the ball. The many interesting things about the ball but i think that. Use of elements. Is that remember the unit any born. Ok of unit ball or any a ball of any radio. Positive radio. Insulin like all of orange trunk. Download. Download small adele. What does mean this. If you. Look ad. Extra. Are you look at any other point in array. Get the direction starting from extra going towards that other phone. All the other point. Look at this direction that starts from extra going. Going towards. Get direction. Ok this is a real that starts. Go to advice. What i can do it without changing the direction. I can simply drink this re all the way down to the point where. Gaon battery. Present completely in the ball. Any direction i can conceive of which is present. Setting for my words which i can go in aryan. All of these directions are also present. Inside the wallet. Charge form from one form to word some point in the. What that means. Super every. Vector. Narayan. I can find. Geeta positive. Such that. Locate. The best. The vector x +. Delta hai. What does. Is vector x + delta. Belongs to. Call delta. Data. Greater than equal to zero and less than equal to. So. Theek hai nahin direction. Any direction. What i can do is. Take the direction and. Kelly down by multiplying it. The factor delta. Such that now x + delta x that direction. Zindabad. This. Lies in the bone and their for indians. Ok so every vector. Director sarath are such that such that one field. Now. Vinod adhiktar is optimal. An optimal solution. What does that mean that mean the death of 1 star. Is less than equal to. Rolex. Birthday. I can in particular take a point like this. Baker point like. Ekta + deltoid which is also live. In particular. Apothic star. Is less than equal to f. Extra + delta. Whenever. Now. Remember. The delta h and b is is the way you shri you what is the factor by which your shrunk the. Chunav make delta smaller and smaller. If data is smaller and smaller than an extra plus delta h is very close to extra it well. Dandiya in the regime of. Dussehra. What does taylor theorem tell you. Malleshwaram. B f. Taylor's theorem tell you that. Map of x + delta h. Equal to f of. Live. Derivative of f. With respect to x evaluated at 1 star. Time. Times now extra minus. 108 match delta h - extra so that's just delta. Love something that was going to zero. Ok now. Go back to what kind of factory it was. It was good to develop theorem said that there was. Ok my slightly bad choice of foundation because they are there is this. I've used it for the function. Patakho ki will still be able to get. Which factor. Hair. Sweater hair which was. Going to be row. It is search type. Itself goes to zero as y goes to zero. Y minus a also goes to zero as y and y courses. Because h goes to zero. Aaj bhai ko 20 what this means is this. Hd bat is love. Is such that if i divide that by y minus a. That also goes to the. Best. So. Another way of writing taylor's theorem would be to say something like this. Would be to say that this. This star plus delta h is equal to effects. Love this derivative x delta. Something which i will write like this. Model of delta. What is what do you mean by small of delta. Value of delta i just the generic notation it stands for the following. Mall of delta is. Is there is any quantity. Such that. Quantity. Safety data sheet of delta such that. Pylokit. Quantity. Sexy doctor. That. Locate the limit. Wallpaper download. / delta. Disco. Ajay thakur. So small of delta means that is approved not only does it itself go to zero. Even after dividing by deltoid goes. So this is the way of writing things in optimisation we make this kind of shorthand we don't. We don't really need to know what this exact thing is. Long as we know. At what weight it goes to. Quantity can go to zero. Badi. But do. Can you can have a quantity that. Seat of delta that goes to zero then. Of delta / delta min. But in this case this is a quantity of data itself was 20. And upon dividing by delta also its one. This should explore the significance of the. What taylor theorem is basically telling us is that affect star plus delta is equal to fx star plus this derivative x x + this quantity. Which is. This between this is something such that. Mode of data / 20. Asphalt 8. Bole to. If that is the case now what we get is. Now a perfect star. Is. Is. Vinod the death of extra is less than equal to f of x +. Iphone 7 plus khelta hai. Consequently we get that. Look at this difference fx star plus delta h - of extra that difference is greater than equal to zero. Consequently i get that this is. Now i can this holds for all. Delta. Gold for all delta. Income neighborhoods zero to eta. So what i can do it if. Delta greater than zero. That allows me to. Device what by delta. In that case i have that. This is true. This is true i can. Now let. Delta go 20. Nagpur give me that. The derivative. Ff. 2x valuator direct ka. Time age. Is greater than equal. Remember this derivative is a row vector is a column vector is time this scalar is greater than equal. Now. I can do this. Ok so this is greater than equal to. What did he want to show if you want to go back to the previous to the claim of the term it was saying that the derivative is equal to zero. What i have got is that this in a product. Bina product. That is written here the derivative sign size. This is guys if greater than equal to 0 for every vector day. Every vector. In general. Because i started off with each other and arbitrary vector and i got that this thing should be greater than. This has to be greater than equal to zero for every vector. Ok what does that mean. This must also be true for minus a. Aur image be true in particular if i take h to be this get negative of this derivative itself. So i can take for instance. Hb. Negative gradient of f. That would then give me that my negative of. Tere bete valuta natak star. Norm of the whole thing square. Greater than. Chunav negative of the norm squared is greater than equal to zero that just mean that. Norm of this derivative. Where is less than equal to zero. But it can't be strictly less than zero. Which means it has to be equal to zero. But when the norm is equal to zero means the vector itself. So that prove that. So now understand the. Consequences of this. And also understand what pic. What limitations are. The consequence mean consequences. Remember. That when you are searching for. Minimum. Of a function word. Oven open set. Infinitely many possible options there. Infinitely many possible choices. What this is saying is. What does serum is saying that well if you want it to look instead of looking over all of them. You can actually limit yourself. Searching over. Ghost voice for which the derivative is equal to. Why does it say that. It is saying that because this is a necessary condition. Any minimum was satisfied. Shopping. Over the pool space. Feasible region. Has become as has been reduced to. Watching over. Solutions of. Desi question. Solution solution the star of the sea. Now. What are you what kind of equations are these. How many variables and how many equation. External cell was in aryan. And this is the derivative of f with respect to x. Any questions in variable. Usually the difficulty arises that these equations are not. Not necessarily linear so you need. Numerical methods. What is this still better than having to search. Heroine indian x. This is how optimisation work you first try to find. Mathematical result which constrained your sir. Then you come up with an algorithm to go and find search in that particular. This is. Otherwise there is you know you would have without without a result you will be searching everywhere. So i want to also. This is one consequence that also. Some cautionary rma. Remember what we say. Remember. Theorem said that if there is a solution. Band smartphone. Ok. Many different cases and some cases that arise because of this kind of. Let's go to all of them. The first. Sholay train. Oscar oasis. So let me write this way existence of solution. Optimal solution. Secondary girls. Number of solutions. Desi crew. Then you have. Kaun si kaun. Take this case by case. Suppose there is an optimal solution. If there is an optimal solution then we know that it must satisfy. It was satisfied that its derivative is equal to. Direction of the mysteries and this must be true. Now suppose that is only one solution. To this bunch of equation. Virat is nonlinear equations. We know that this is nonlinear equations must this or must be satisfied by the optimal schedule. But there may also be. Other. Other things other points that's all these 9 lena. But suppose there is. Only one solution. Hoodies. Nandini. Facebook support. Only one telugu. What does that mean. Latest video optimus. Every optimal solution must satisfy this this set of equation. This set of equations have only one cell. It has to be done that solution is the ok. Ok so then the extra that solve this set of equation. Is. Is the unique optimal. There is. A solution. Today. State of equation. To the optimisation problem there is an optimal. When you look at these non linear equations. You will find more than one point satisfy. More than one point. Solve this. Mujhe man point extra solved. More than one point that. That causes what does that mean. It doesn't mean. Any of those. Any of those could be. Good afternoon. Nobody nobody kalakand. Suppose there is no optimal solution. There is no optimal solution. And. No solution here also. Then then again nothing can be said. Suppose there is. Again. Suppose there is no optimal solution. But there is a unique point at which you can solve. The system of equation. What can one conclude about this. Again we can't say anything. Remember because the theorem started with the premise that. You have a solution. There is no solution the theorem will not tell you anything. And again once again there is no. No optimal solution and then there is. More than one. More than one solution. Today. That also does not say. I will. Lakshmi. Let me illustrate this for. For you. Rustom example. Let's do the first kiss first. Bus cases when there is an optimal solution and that is a unique. Unique solution. What are you doing i will take us to be se -1 to 1 the open interval -1 to 1. Endless summer. Functions illustrating this. 1. 1. I am minimising this reserve. Find that there is a unique point like this. Where. The derivative has become equal. Then it has to be that this is also the. This is happy ke. S p s. Once again i am on -121. Brijesh. And. I get i have a function that look like this. Now if you look at the derivative of this function. Which of the function has become zero here. Nepal to become zero here. There are no more no more than one point. Weather derivative as vanish. We need to dig deeper. In order to conclude what we offer. In this case we have to dig deeper than that so that you have provided does not can help us including. What was case we look like. No optimal solution and no derivative also does not marry. Good night pic. Sudesh take for visa tracking. I want to keep the domain is -1 to 1. August 1 riyal. Distance. Line lag. Where is there is there is no optimal solution the infimum is not attended. It would have been attained at -1 if -1 was part of. Dadi aur daman is open. Not attend. And also that function tape is such that its derivative. Does not balance. Katpur. Orange. Aur. Battery case. Tricky because. Your you have a unique solution to the to the equation the derivative is equal to zero. But. There is no guarantee that the optimal solution actually does not. What is outlook. Justin what this figure 1. Define what does figure 1. Represent this. Ok this sort of. Where is more since there is no. Bp mum is not attend. But there is this point here. Weather derivative ashwini. Is 4 is often responsible for many errors because. Code checking the solution exist people jump into checking. Solutions of. Derivative equal to zero. Open come up with. Answer that are not. Solutions of the. Optimal solution. London. 5 would look. Say something like this. -1. Again. Multiple point. Weather derivative is vanishing. There is no solution. Harishchandra natak. Illustrate. Now let me come to the point. That one of yours. What about existence now. Remember biscuit tera existence under what condition. Objective function has to be continuous. And feasible region has to be closed and bounded. Feasible region that open. Not closed then is we could be bounded but it's not necessarily. Ok to dehradun train set that both closed and open. Border border. Isliye is no guarantee of close being close. Surendra for you need another. Independent way of verifying that the solution actually exist. Bring me back to the first point and we need the reason the importance of weierstrass theorem in optimisation is that it lets you check for a better solution exist. Without actually asking you to find one. Sunao. Up. Without having a guarantee a way of living that a solution exists. You can be in this kind of situation. 10. You not try and find one and you find all this point. But none of them guarantee about any. Dam reason to be not. Also that is so if you go back to the argument. Baby frock design. Why we say we started with the same saying that extra be an optimal solution of this. Particular optimization problem. What do we do with side we have to this particular optimization problem. And wish we said. Let's look at this optimisation let's look at every direction. Enarayan. Bring the direction down to to the point where now it lies inside the ball and therefore inside the set. And then you can say something about the inner product between the. Between the direction and the derivative. 24 this this kind of argument. Can also be done. If you are. If you are talking of not. Global optimal solution. What are local optimal. So. Yeah i was referring to optimal solution means a global optimal solution i was. I use this particular thing. This particular property. B i i i used this. Mere ko sarees less than equal effect. Olx ns. We don't need to do that we can we can we can also work with the local optimal solution. Endure in time local optima. Your ideas will continue to work. I can still look for vector that. In my local neighborhood. Best neighborhood can i can bring that better for the down to the point where it lies completely in a. Again to complete repeat the same. What this means is this this particular. Result. Actually also gives us. Nithya ram. About theorem. Also hold. Aur ekta. Natak. Local. Local optimal solution for local minima. 24 what this means is if. Ecstar. Is a local minimum. Aap. Valuated. Now suppose we get to this position where are you now have. You have. You can you are in one of these situations you have you know that the solution exist. Federal multiple points where. Multiple point. Point point more than one point extra that solve this. Set. Derivative equal to zero or gradient equal. What. So can be eliminated from office. So that's what we can we look at. Locate now. Sholay. Considered. Suppose suppose. Fb. Voice defence. Latest car. Bp. Local. Then it must be that. Derivative is equal to zero. Now we can actually use. Stronger version of taylor swift. When a function when you have price when the function is twice differentiable. Slugterra you can use taylor theorem. To get. There is stronger version of taylor's theorem that makes second use of also the second with. Show the tell the taylor theorem ise i wrote. Please use the only the first derivative. It was. It's that you can come front of the linear approximate. Of the function near that one. If you also have second derivative information. Can you can actually construct a quadratic approx. Ok so that that's. Karan that we will use to by taylor's theorem. Tere tere hd me like that. Your pic star plus. Delta h. Is equal to f of x 6. Plus. Fx star plus. Effect. Plus. Aap. Delta square. Hr transport. News. Consistent with one kind of motivation. Lucknow. Quantity the recipe all quantities. Dot.com. Is now small of delta square. 2nd puc political process. And quantity that. The residual error that remains after that quadratic approximation. Small of data square what is mean this. This is now a function that after dividing by delta square also. Satta.com. But now i remember this. Because if is extra is a local minimum. This gradient hair is equal to zero. This first time is gone. So you are left with just a perfect star. Plus aap. Delta square. H transpose. Square fat. Star apps. Plus. Mall of qatar. Now once again we have. In a small neighborhood. F of x star plus delta h. Will be late will be greater than equal to a perfect sir. Super delta small enough. What this. This implies that. You have. Half. Delta square. H transpose. Delta positive and. Reliance mall inox. What that means. You can you can advise what by you can divide by delta and then let delta go 20. Hr transport. Greater than equal to. This must be true for. Did you get this condition is transpose. Asian of hf at extra time. Should be greater than equal to zero. Weather condition this to be true. This is true for all. Upar wale. Hindi super college this just. Abe tricks like this matrix. Like this that satisfies. This kind of inequality. Matrix. Of this kind which satisfies. Anil quality like this for all. College. Sort of matrix is called positive semidefinite. Define. Define that for user. Set. Positive. Semidefinite. V transport. Movie. Greater than equal to zero. Call veena. So. Vidyut. With this definition what we ask what we get is that. Look at this hessian matrix evaluated at ekta. Must be. Positive seminar. Christmas be positive. If your. F is. Y is differentiable. We can say more we can say that. If you are ekta is a local minimum not only much the derivative equal to zero. Among the points where the derivative is equal to zero you for the cheque. You can for the narrow down. Table. Karate points where. Bastion is positive definite. Then i want. 2000 your optimal solutions must be amongst. This is now in history. What about efficiency sufficiency means what. Necessary means simply that 16 solution this is a condition that. The solution was added. Sufficiency means the other vera. Efficiency means the other way around here is a condition if i get if i can verify. Then definitely that's. Now. How was what would be a sufficient condition in this case. Sufficient conditions are stronger than necessary. Because the patient condition road in flight. What will what would be. What would be the sufficient condition. Rakesh. You must have the derivative is equal to that is that that that such that is necessary. Bus also. And but in addition to this there is the second derivative being. Arbi husain being positive semidefinite. If you ask for something more. Yaar beli. Baby hasini. Weakly positive definite. Positive definite. Then that ensures that this. The director is a local. So. Sufficient condition. It is positive definite. What does that mean. That means that. V transport. 10 square feet. Taraweeh. This is positive. For all we that are not zero. If you have your. Next hour. Nice such that the derivative is equal to zero. And the. Hessian is positive definite that means we transfers the halcyon times we again. Strictly positive for all b not equal to zero. Then the text is a. Show the optimisation over open sets is that. Does not always not a very common problem that occur. The kind of. When one writes. And optimisation problem like this your writing a minimization of a function f. Subject to. Sabjiyon pics. Nasbandi equal to zero and h of x. 20. The less than equal to zero and educate equal to zero this kind of constraints. Is functions g and h are continuous. These constraints ensure that your site is actually close. Bp double vision. But. This. Closed. Zika virus. Class of problems where it's very important to consider. Baby hi baby naturally encounter open set. Adoor weather on open. Sabhi problem of minimising effect. Just. Is in orion mall. This is what called unconstrained minimizer. Unconstrained minimization. This. This is actually a minimization over an open set because. Are itself is an open. On the previous results that i just mentioned a all apply to minimization over and over. Aur over. Ovary nankan foreign minimization of in unconstrained. Unconstrained meaning. You can add another point to note is that suppose you had installed maximization. Instead of minimization. About the results day. Yes so what would my your conclusions change. Extrusion. The conclusion of of. Office 13 here. Whether derivative is equal to zero this contribution will continue to work. Even if you have a maximum. Garbhvati. Has to be zero. The conclusion of. Office decorum. This conclusion year. Red light. This. Blue line. That behaviour must be positive semidefinite. Seems to be positive semidefinite that gets changed to hasten should be negative samet. And sufficient condition will change to. Hasin should be next. Positive definite. Negative. Negative definite simply means that in place of. Please semidefinite would just switch this inequality to a less than equal to. And this inequality also. Takle lakkha. I am asking about this details can. Is it workout. Sauvie island. \""
